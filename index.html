  </h1>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">The music companies only look for profit from their song</h3>
    <pre style="font-weight: 800;">but they do not want to check what makes music passionite 
      as a result they like to put their songs on streaming services
      as that is pretty much an easy cash cow for the record albums 
      (this reason applies to normal pop music compaines outside of south korea
      but in sk's case it's much worse)since koreans used that shady method to their advantage
      they gotten so much profit from that gangam style song from 2012
      which was bad but due to 24 billion views it made a lot of profit naturally
      a lot more companies and artists wanted to follow suit from that success
      but however most kpoop record compaines overwork and abuse their artists
      most artists have to be quiet about itor otherwise they won't be famous and forgotten shotly after 1 song.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">As for the songs themself's since kpoop is only ment to be mass marketable</h3>
    <pre style="font-weight: 800;">
      as most artists aren't bothered or tasked to make their own lyrics, or sing songs with their own 
      voices, not only that top the fact that there aren't any instuments in the music videos 
      since everything is electronic and fake it makes an easy job for the record companies 
      since they can show plastic gae men or lesbian? bitches with too much makeup than 
      needed on a shitty video and it will still make a huge pile of profit for them and with 
      that they can shove it down everyone by playing it (on radio, tv, internet, movies ect.) 
      while its trending for 2 years before it stops making enough profits and the song along 
      with the artists (depends on how popular the artist is) starts to be forgotten shortly. 
      As for the role models well in order to be famous you need to look like plastic with too
      much make up for appeal for both genders if the person doesn't make this criteria 
      then the song even if its good with the singing is automaticly discarded along with the
      person the kpoop indusrty took thses shady tactics seirosly.

    <h1 class="hed">Summary</h1>
    <p> Lame music only to cash on trends and teens, 
      <br>
      Exploting artists for shitty music only for fame, 
      <br>
      No creativaty at all most of the songs take more writers than singers, Forgetable music.</p>
